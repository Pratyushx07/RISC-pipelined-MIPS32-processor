# RISC Pipelined MIPS32 Processor (Verilog)

A **5-stage pipelined MIPS32 processor** (classic **RISC architecture**) implemented in **Verilog** and functionally verified using multiple directed testbenches.

The design follows the standard pipeline stages **IF, ID, EX, MEM, WB** and supports arithmetic, memory, and control-flow instructions. Verification includes arithmetic operations, load–store sequences, and a loop-based factorial program.

This project focuses on **pipeline behavior and correctness**, rather than FPGA deployment.
